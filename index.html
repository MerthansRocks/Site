            <p>(SAMPLE TEXT) In geology, sedimentary rocks are formed through the deposition and solidification of sediment, while igneous rocks are formed from the cooling and solidification of magma or lava. Metamorphic rocks are created when existing rocks are subjected to heat and pressure, causing them to recrystallize into new forms. The study of rocks and their formation is known as petrology. Geologists also study the movement and deformation of the Earth's crust, including tectonic plates, faults, and earthquakes. The field of geology is essential in understanding the Earth's history, as well as predicting and mitigating natural hazards such as landslides and volcanic eruptions.</p>
